TODO
-Check if a block is made by an opponent before moving a player
-Introduce or modify a function that captures a piece when the currnt player's selected piece is inout as a oarameter


Destroy blocks, when 3 sixes are rolled consecutively


Final
-Modify capture piece to accomodate multiple pieces
-Set print statement in that loop thingy in CreateBlock()

canCreateBlock and CreateBLock do not account for the moving in the home straight. THis might be what leads to a segmentation error
There is an error at moveBLock that gives a ngative value. Fix this
